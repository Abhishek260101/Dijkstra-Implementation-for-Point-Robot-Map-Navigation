Libraries and Essentials Required: Numpy, Matplotlib, Math, Time, FuncAnimation, HeapQ, CV2

Step 1: You can run the Map.Py to see the Map and Obstacles.
Step 2: Run Dijkstra_Abhishek_Avhad.py
Step 3: Enter Initial and Goal Node (X Y). Make sure to use space between two values
Step 4: Now the code will run you will have to wait for 1-3 mins maximum to see the output animation.

Sample Inputs:
Initial X, Y = 20 20
Goal X, Y = 180 100

Initial X, Y = 20 100
Goal X, Y = 1125 20
